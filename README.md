# Beans, Borders and Bets - A Visual Journey Into the Coffee Market

This is a data storytelling project where you will discover a different side of the coffee market. The project contains various files, of which three are key. The first is data_prep.ipynb, used for loading and cleaning the data. The second is data_vis.ipynb used to create visualisations and output them as json files for html embedding. The last one is index.html to construct the final web-based blog.
